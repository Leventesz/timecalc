TimeCalc
========
A simple timesheet calculator for adding up hours worked.  You can see a live version here: http://timecalc.herokuapp.com

I designed this to have a small app to tinker with JavaScript and related technologies. So far it incorporates: 
* [JQuery] for UI behavior
* [Bootstrap] for styling
* [Moment] for time parsing
* [Require] for modular script loading
* [Jasmine] for BDD specification tests
* [Heroku] for hosting using a thin Ruby [Rack] layer

In the future I plan to try out:
* convert to objects
* [Cucumber] acceptance testing
* [Knockout] for UI interactions
* [Mustache] templating
* [LESS] for CSS (or Sass Compass)
* [Underscore] or Lo-Dash for functional constructs

Todo
----

Features Todo
-------------
* tool tips on headers with help
* garbage times should not convert ("kjsdf" or "900")
* should leave break times there, normalized??
* Should allow checkbox to round to nearest .25
* times like "900"

Questions
---------
- how to namespace with the IIFE and let jasmine see it?
- consider using input type=time, number; what versions are supported?
- JSLint
  - why does it think else cannot come after return in a block? 172
  - learn more about hoisting as to why vars have to be declared at once
  - other stuff it didn't like
    - slint src/timecalc.js  --maxerr=10000 --indent=2 --white --undef --sloppy
    - doesn't like top down method definitions (using before defined)
    - indent=2
    - doesn't like my whitespace
    - not using strict mode
- CSSLint
  - better to be more specific or general in selectors? / 
    what are performance ramification of overqualifying? how did it know it's
    overqualified, in case I had other elements with same class?
- how to get code review on github?
  - switch default branch to empty and remove everything
  - create another branch to full and add all the code
  - issue a pull request

Stories Complete
-----------------
- should display 5 rows with 3 columns
- should label rows: day 1, day 2, ...
- should display 3 column headers: Time In, Time Out, Break Length
- alignment in input fields should be on right side
- after each focus change, should update hours for each day after entered
- after each focus change, should compute total hours for entire week
- clicking on an item should select it
- start w focus in first field
- entering any invalid number in break field wipes it out and its value is 0
- a total negative time makes the total go red to indicate an error
- valid times must be for in and out else no total is shown for that row (and its value is 0)
- fields 1 and 2 are interpreted as times and field 3 as a duration
- should understand time formats: 9, 9p, 9pm, 9:15, 9:15pm, 9:15p
- out time less than in time should result in error; highlighting in red
- if out is less than in, infer PM unless merdiem was explicitly stated
- replace the time with the normalized time so there is no confusion on what was selected
- limit the precision on any number to 2 decimal places
- BDD spec tests with Jasmine
- should return undefined for junk not 12am
- When visiting the page, should be able to see directions: â€¦
- When visiting the page, should be one row displayed at first
- After filling out the last valid row, another is added
- Should be able to click a button to clear to start over (reload?)
- Deploy to host environment (Heroku)
