TimeCalc
========
A simple timesheet calculator for adding up hours worked.  

I designed this to have a small app to tinker with JavaScript and related technologies. So far it incorporates: 
* [JQuery] for UI behavior
* [Bootstrap] for styling
* [Moment] for time parsing
* [Jasmine] for BDD specification tests
* [Herkou] for hosting using a thin Ruby [Rack] layer

In the future I play to try out:
* [Cucumber] acceptance testing
* [Knockout] for UI interactions
* [Mustache] templating
* [LESS] for CSS
* Underscore or Lo-Dash for functional constructs

Todo
----
- rearrange files in directories
- Github for feedback -- how to allow comments?
- HTML validation
- CSS validation
- JSLint
---
- Switch to using Web Hosted JS files? for jquery?
* tool tips on headers with help
* garbage times should not convert ("kjsdf" or "900")
? should leave break times there, normalized
* Should allow checkbox to round to nearest .25
* times like "900"

Questions
---------
- better to be more specific or general in selectors?
- how to properly center the h1
- should i have used tables, and nested tables?
- consider using input type=time, number; what versions are supported?

Stories Complete
-----------------
x should display 5 rows with 3 columns
x should label rows: day 1, day 2, ...
x should display 3 column headers: Time In, Time Out, Break Length
x alignment in input fields should be on right side
x after each focus change, should update hours for each day after entered
x after each focus change, should compute total hours for entire week
x clicking on an item should select it
x start w focus in first field
x entering any invalid number in break field wipes it out and its value is 0
x a total negative time makes the total go red to indicate an error
x valid times must be for in and out else no total is shown for that row (and its value is 0)
x fields 1 and 2 are interpreted as times and field 3 as a duration
x should understand time formats: 9, 9p, 9pm, 9:15, 9:15pm, 9:15p
x out time less than in time should result in error; highlighting in red
x if out is less than in, infer PM unless merdiem was explicitly stated
x replace the time with the normalized time so there is no confusion on what was selected
x limit the precision on any number to 2 decimal places
x BDD spec tests with Jasmine
x should return undefined for junk not 12am
x When visiting the page, should be able to see directions: â€¦
x When visiting the page, should be one row displayed at first
x After filling out the last valid row, another is added
x Should be able to click a button to clear to start over (reload?)
x Deploy to host environment (Heroku)
